Hi! I am Daniel Guerra
=====================================================================================================================================

Videogame and Virtual Environments Developer. 🕹️
--------------

🎓 I graduated in Game Design and Development from UCJC, with an HND in Creative Media Production—game Development, and a Master's degree in Business Administration (MBA) from UNIR. I also have an FCE (B2) from Cambridge and Google Project Management Certification.

🧑‍💻 I have several years of professional experience as a software developer for projects in Research, Development, and Innovation (R+D+i) for systems based on Virtual Reality, Simulators, and Serious Games for leaders companies in Spain such as Innovae Group, Technological Institute of Castilla y Leon (ITCL), and now at INVELON.

🧑‍🏫 I have always liked to communicate, which has led me to work as a trainer and teacher at the University of Burgos. I have also offered to help, as a private tutor, vocational training, and university students, mainly focusing on technologies such as Framework C# .NET, and Unity3D.

📣 I have been a guest speaker at Universidad de Oviedo, FIMP, Festival Creando, and UBU Party.

🎯 My goals are to create, innovate, and influence through the use of immersive technologies and videogames. You can see some of my personal and commercial projects on my website and portfolio.
